# CATARINO-RUSH

The main theme of the game is based on Volkswagen Beetles (vochos). There are 3 levels, each increasing slightly in difficulty. When the program starts, it will first display a menu with three buttons: one to play, one to show the controls, and another to exit. When you click on play, level 1 will start. The objective is to dodge enemies, which in this case are other cars. You have to jump over them, and to advance to the next level, you must collect 3 coins. If you fail to do so, you lose. You start with 5 lives, and you lose if you lose all 5 lives. The number of lives remains constant at 5 across all levels. If you lose all your lives, youâ€™ll return to level 1 and have to start over. The goal is to complete all 3 levels with the highest score possible.
